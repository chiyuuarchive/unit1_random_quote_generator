 Random Quote Generator

 The application "Random Quote Generator" prints translated quotes from a Japanese psychological thriller series named Psycho Pass. Each quote presented on the webpage reveals the source, citation, year of utterance, season and episode of when the quote was recorded.

 The application consists of four functions:
 - "getRandomQuote": Retrieve a random quote from a collection (array) of quotes using the Javascript built-in object, Math. 
 - "getBackgroundColor": Generate a background color for the webpage with randomely produced hue values.
 - "printQuote": Concatenates the content of a quote (object) and print it on the html file. 
 - "quoteTimer": A timer that updates the printed quote and background color according to set values (10s).

 In addition, the user is able to change the quote and background color manually by clicking on the "Show another quote" button presented on top-right corner of the webpage. This was done possible via "event listeners" provided by Treehouse Island, Inc.
